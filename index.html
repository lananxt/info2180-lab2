                <article> Hello there! Here I'll do a brief description about myself. I'm a 22 year old Sagittarius. I am currently a 4th year Software Engineering Student. In my spare time, I enjoy playing The Sims. I'm very much an introvert but I do enjoy quality time with my loved ones and friends. Here's a brief description of what the sims is: The Sims is a series of life simulation video games developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. The franchise has sold nearly 200 million copies worldwide, and it is one of the best-selling video game series of all time.<br>

                <br>The games in the Sims series are largely sandbox games, in that they lack any defined goals (except for some later expansion packs and console versions which introduced this gameplay style). The player creates virtual people called "Sims," places them in houses, and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Players can either place their Sims in pre-constructed homes or build them themselves. Each successive expansion pack and game in the series augmented what the player could do with their Sims.The Sims series is part of the larger Sim series, started by SimCity in 1989.</article><br>

                <h2> Poems about Life</h2>
                <img src="info2180%20image3.jpg" alt="Blog Post 1">
                <article> I think poems are a great way to express yourself. So I will leave two poems that really captures the true essence of life.<br>

                <br>"Life is an opportunity, benefit from it. Life is beauty, admire it. Life is a dream, realize it. Life is a challenge, meet it. Life is a duty, complete it. Life is a game, play it. Life is a promise, fullfil it. Life is sorrow, overcome it. Life is a song, sing it. Life is a struggle, accept it. Life is a tragedy, confront it. Life is an adventure, dare it. Life is luck, make it. Life is too precious, do not destroy it. Life is life, fight for it.<br>


                <br>"Sometimes I can't find the words. That fill my messy head. Can't find the effort to smile or get out of my silly old bed.The world just sometimes feels like I don't fit and don't belong, And even when I make the effort, A smile just doesn't last long.I could pretend with all my might That I am the happiest I can be. Surrounded by the world, it seems Lonelier I couldn't be.Not sure what may be the answer.Not sure if I'm really keen To spend another day here, Living this dreadful dream.But I must find some courage,Light a fire inside my heart And find a love for life again,And I know where I shall start.I'll walk among the forest And feel the crisp sea breezeAnd lay among the meadow And listen to all the bees.I'll figure out the mayhem And gaze at all the stars And dance at every sunset With a smile inside my heart".<br></article>
